## What is Lingua? 🧠

Lingua provides a streamlined flashcard experience, making language acquisition intuitive and engaging:

* **Focused Learning:** Concentrate on a single word at a time, presented clearly on a digital flashcard.
* **Timed Reveal:** When the app starts, or a new card appears, there's a subtle 3-second pause. This gives you just enough time to recall the word before the card automatically flips to reveal its English translation.
* **Interactive Feedback:**
    * Click the **"Check" (✔)** button if you correctly guessed the word. This word will then be removed from your active learning list (`words_to_learn.csv`), ensuring you focus on what you still need to master.
    * Click the **"X"** button if you didn't know the word. It will remain in your learning list for future practice.
* **Simple, Clean UI:** A minimalist design ensures your focus stays on the language, not on distractions.

## Technologies Under the Hood 💻

Lingua is powered by robust and versatile Python libraries:

* **Python Tkinter:** For building the graphical user interface, providing a native desktop application feel.
* **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation, making it easy to read, process, and update your vocabulary lists from CSV files.
* **CSV:** Your vocabulary is stored in simple, human-readable CSV files, allowing for easy customization and expansion.

* **Progress Tracking:** More detailed insights into your learning journey.

## Language Trivia! Did You Know? 🤯

Learning a new language is a monumental task, but it's often more achievable than you think!

* **Chinese Language:** Mandarin Chinese is estimated to have over **80,000 characters** (though many are archaic or rarely used). However, to read a newspaper, you typically only need to know around **2,000-3,000 characters**!
* **Average Vocabulary:** While dictionaries contain hundreds of thousands of words, an average native English speaker actively uses about **20,000-35,000 words**. For basic conversational fluency in a new language, you might only need around **2,000-3,000 words**! Lingua helps you target these high-frequency words first.
